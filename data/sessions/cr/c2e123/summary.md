* Caleb and Beau examine their red eye tattoos
* They are unaffected by greater restoration, nor acid
* We are headed towards Aeor
* On the way, they encounter wolves running north
* The wolves are running from a white dragon
* We hide in the snow
* We realizes the dragon is Geldion
* The party scatters, running away from the dragon
* We manage to beat back the dragon, who flees
* Caduceus asks Dagen to notify Essek about what's coming
* Dagen agrees, for a payment of 2000 gold
* The party rests 2-3 hours away from Aeor
* Using commune, we find out that Essek wants to help the party, and the tombtakers do not plan on sacrificing the party, although it's unknown whether the tattoos can be used against the party
* We find fresh footprints, believing them to be the Tombtakers'
* We polymorph into owls to track the Tombtakers
* Suddenly, our darkvision goggles stop working, and Caleb's polymorph is dispelled
* In a battle with the Tombtakers, we aren't able to defeat them, but by making it look like Gelidon has returned, we're able to disengage from the fight
